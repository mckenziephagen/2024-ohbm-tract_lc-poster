              challenge due to the immense complexity of global brain networks.
              Here we introduce a noninvasive method that uses diffusion MRI to
              characterize whole-brain white matter architecture as a single
              local connectome fingerprint that allows for a direct comparison
              between structural connectomes. In four independently acquired
              data sets with repeated scans (total N = 213), we show that the
              local connectome fingerprint is highly specific to an individual,
              allowing for an accurate self-versus-others classification that
              achieved 100\% accuracy across 17,398 identification tests. The
              estimated classification error was approximately one thousand
              times smaller than fingerprints derived from diffusivity-based
              measures or region-to-region connectivity patterns for repeat
              scans acquired within 3 months. The local connectome fingerprint
              also revealed neuroplasticity within an individual reflected as a
              decreasing trend in self-similarity across time, whereas this
              change was not observed in the diffusivity measures. Moreover,
              the local connectome fingerprint can be used as a phenotypic
              marker, revealing 12.51\% similarity between monozygotic twins,
              5.14\% between dizygotic twins, and 4.51\% between none-twin
              siblings, relative to differences between unrelated subjects.
              This novel approach opens a new door for probing the influence of
              pathological, genetic, social, or environmental factors on the
              unique configuration of the human connectome.",

  abstract = "Tractography based on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data is a
              method for identifying the major white matter fascicles (tracts)
              in the living human brain. The health of these tracts is an
              important factor underlying many cognitive and neurological
              disorders. In vivo, tissue properties may vary systematically
              along each tract for several reasons: different populations of
              axons enter and exit the tract, and disease can strike at local
              positions within the tract. Hence quantifying and understanding
              diffusion measures along each fiber tract (Tract Profile) may
              reveal new insights into white matter development, function, and
              disease that are not obvious from mean measures of that tract. We
              demonstrate several novel findings related to Tract Profiles in
              the brains of typically developing children and children at risk
              for white matter injury secondary to preterm birth. First,
              fractional anisotropy (FA) values vary substantially within a
              tract but the Tract FA Profile is consistent across subjects.
              Thus, Tract Profiles contain far more information than mean
              diffusion measures. Second, developmental changes in FA occur at
              specific positions within the Tract Profile, rather than along
              the entire tract. Third, Tract Profiles can be used to compare
              white matter properties of individual patients to standardized
              Tract Profiles of a healthy population to elucidate unique
              features of that patient's clinical condition. Fourth, Tract
              Profiles can be used to evaluate the association between white
              matter properties and behavioral outcomes. Specifically, in the
              preterm group reading ability is positively correlated with FA
              measured at specific locations on the left arcuate and left
              superior longitudinal fasciculus and the magnitude of the
              correlation varies significantly along the Tract Profiles. We
              introduce open source software for automated fiber-tract
              quantification (AFQ) that measures Tract Profiles of MRI
              parameters for 18 white matter tracts. With further validation,
              AFQ Tract Profiles have potential for informing clinical
              management and decision-making.",

  abstract = "The white matter contains long-range connections between
              different brain regions and the organization of these connections
              holds important implications for brain function in health and
              disease. Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
              imaging (dMRI) to quantify tissue properties along the
              trajectories of these connections. Statistical inference from
              tractometry usually either averages these quantities along the
              length of each fiber bundle or computes regression models
              separately for each point along every one of the bundles. These
              approaches are limited in their sensitivity, in the former case,
              or in their statistical power, in the latter. We developed a
              method based on the sparse group lasso (SGL) that takes into
              account tissue properties along all of the bundles and selects
              informative features by enforcing both global and bundle-level
              sparsity. We demonstrate the performance of the method in two
              settings: i) in a classification setting, patients with
              amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are accurately distinguished
              from matched controls. Furthermore, SGL identifies the
              corticospinal tract as important for this classification,
              correctly finding the parts of the white matter known to be
              affected by the disease. ii) In a regression setting, SGL
              accurately predicts ``brain age.'' In this case, the weights are
              distributed throughout the white matter indicating that many
              different regions of the white matter change over the lifespan.
              Thus, SGL leverages the multivariate relationships between
              diffusion properties in multiple bundles to make accurate
              phenotypic predictions while simultaneously discovering the most
              relevant features of the white matter.",
