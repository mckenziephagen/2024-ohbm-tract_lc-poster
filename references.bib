  abstract = "Quantifying differences or similarities in connectomes has been a
              challenge due to the immense complexity of global brain networks.
              Here we introduce a noninvasive method that uses diffusion MRI to
              characterize whole-brain white matter architecture as a single
              local connectome fingerprint that allows for a direct comparison
              between structural connectomes. In four independently acquired
              data sets with repeated scans (total N = 213), we show that the
              local connectome fingerprint is highly specific to an individual,
              allowing for an accurate self-versus-others classification that
              achieved 100\% accuracy across 17,398 identification tests. The
              estimated classification error was approximately one thousand
              times smaller than fingerprints derived from diffusivity-based
              measures or region-to-region connectivity patterns for repeat
              scans acquired within 3 months. The local connectome fingerprint
              also revealed neuroplasticity within an individual reflected as a
              decreasing trend in self-similarity across time, whereas this
              change was not observed in the diffusivity measures. Moreover,
              the local connectome fingerprint can be used as a phenotypic
              marker, revealing 12.51\% similarity between monozygotic twins,
              5.14\% between dizygotic twins, and 4.51\% between none-twin
              siblings, relative to differences between unrelated subjects.
              This novel approach opens a new door for probing the influence of
              pathological, genetic, social, or environmental factors on the
              unique configuration of the human connectome.",
